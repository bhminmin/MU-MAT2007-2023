    Approximates the golden ratio of the given number.
    The Fibonacci sequence starts at 1, therefore all values have to be greater than 1

    To calculate the golden ratio n has to be divided by the previous index,
    so the both indexes get calculated with the nthFibonacci() method and saved as the variables a and b.
    Therefore, the golden ratio is the division between a and b, in other words: n/n-1.
